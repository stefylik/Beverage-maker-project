# Bevreage-maker-project
## Personal project in C++
The project is a C++ simulation of a beverage maker that caters to coffee and tea recipes. It leverages fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and utilizes text files to store the recipes. The user interface (UI) is implemented through a console menu with two sub-menus: one for user interactions and another for administrative functions.

### Key Features:

User Menu: Allows users to place orders for their preferred beverage.\
Admin Menu: Accessible via a password, enabling administrators to manage resources, view recipes, and monitor container quantities.\
Recipe Handling: Utilizes text files to store and retrieve beverage recipes.\
Multithreading: Simulates beverage preparation time using thread.sleep for enhanced realism.\
